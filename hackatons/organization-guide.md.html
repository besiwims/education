## Introduction

### What is a Hackathon

It’s a design event where just about anyone involved in software
development—even subject matter experts—gather to work on software
projects. They are intense, sprint-like sessions that can last between a
day and a week. They often have themes like programming languages,
operating systems, APIs, industries and even programming demographics.
And winning one is a rush.

This is a guide on how to organize Plutus and Marlowe Hackathons

### The Types of Hackathons You Can Organize

You can create a hackathon with different purposes. The most common are:

- Introduce Cardano technology: Showcase what’s cool and motivate
    > developers to learn something new.

- Innovation labs: Get your team to work together on disruptive ideas
    > for current challenges or invite developers to bring fresh
    > perspectives.

- Social awareness: Gather great minds to solve society’s problems
    > through creativity and by developing new solutions.

## Phase 1 \| Initial Considerations

Depending on the scale of the event, you need from 3-10 weeks to
properly prepare for the event. Creating a hackathon starts with making
decisions that will affect everything else. If you decide on a two-day
hackathon, food and an overnight venue has to be part of the plan. If
it’s a one-day hackathon, the agenda will be different.

### Choose the Topic or Theme

As you consider your hackathon topic or theme, ask yourself the
following questions:

- What would you like the hackathon to accomplish?

- What problem do you want to solve?

- What do you want participants to build?

Next, announce the topic in advance so people have an idea of what
they’ll be doing. An effective strategy is to offer a general topic and
then give a more detailed briefing at the kick-off session on the day of
the hackathon. That way, you’ll be sure that it’s fair for everyone.

### Choose a Date

Weekends are when participants are most available, so your dates should
probably fall on a Saturday or Sunday. Holiday weekends, however, are
not a good bet, so check your calendar carefully, especially if it’s an
online hackathon and there will be participants from around the world.

### Choose a Technology

Hackathons tend to focus on building an app or software using specific
coding techniques, programming languages, operating systems, and
development platforms. So, when you think about what you’d like
participants to build, you should also consider the technology involved.

### Define the Format

There are different hackathon formats: 8 hours, 24 hours or 30 hours;
starting on Friday night or on Saturday morning and running for 48
hours; running it for a week remotely or on-site. Defining the format
has everything to do with your goals and output.

So, you need to settle on those first. Is your hackathon going to be
about developing an app? Or a new solution for a problem? Perhaps you’re
looking for an innovative approach to a common activity or process? Or
maybe you have no idea and are just going to pick a hot topic?

Starting on a Friday can be a problem because the initial brainstorm
phase is fuzzy and people get tired quickly. If you start on a Saturday
morning around 9 AM and finish by Sunday afternoon, you’ll be sure that
participants are engaged during the final presentations. The format is
an important decision because it will help you choose the venue.

### Teams or Individuals

Another important decision is whether participants can enter as
individuals and team up at the event or if the individuals enter as a
team. If they enter as teams, you should have requirements that they
fulfil such as how many team members, if there will be different roles
on the teams and other considerations. If you’re inviting individuals to
team up at the hackathon, you should be prepared to have a team-building
session. Teams should have 3-5 participants because that number works
best in a hackathon environment and people can take turns having breaks.
Fewer than 3 creates a lot of work and pressure and more than 5 can
create confusion.

If you want individuals to form teams, a good tactic is to hold a
pre-event (maybe Friday night) where people can meet and decide who they
want to team with. You can also use a communications channel (like Slack
or Telegram).

### Choose Your Evaluation Criteria

When you announce the hackathon, include the evaluation criteria as part
of the announcement or make sure you share it shortly thereafter. That
way, participants know what they’re fighting for and what counts toward
their goal for winning. If you’re not sure how to go about this, here’s
a [sample](#hackathon-evaluation-criteria).

### Reserve a Venue

Your venue is one of the first things you have to nail down after you’ve
decided on your format. As you look for the right venue to book, here
are some things to consider:

- What is the wifi strength, reliability and availability?

- Who will be the speakers for the final presentation?

- Are there sufficient power outlets?

- Is there easy access to them?

- Are the chairs comfortable?

- Are the tables the right size?

- Are restrooms located close to where participants will be working?

- Is there a place to eat?

- Are there places to rest?

### Define Your Schedule

When you’re promoting your hackathon, you should provide an agenda.
Don’t overthink this, because you can always change the timetable. In
addition, preparing the agenda will help you define these important
milestones:

● Breakfast: Glucose is the primary source of energy for every cell in
the body and most participants will be hungry. You’ll want to make sure
their sugar levels are up when they kick off!

● Start and Finish: Participants need to know when to be there, when to
travel, and they might want to book hotels

● Welcome Session: You can give them the briefing at that time or just
say welcome and perhaps have a short presentation about your
organization. Remember: these people are eager to start; they will have
a short attention span so don’t spend much time on this.

● Knowledge Sessions: Quick talks on a specific topic can be helpful.
However, some participants might not join in because these sessions cut
into their development time, and their goal is to win. An agenda usually
has the following elements:

| Day 1                    | Day 2                   |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| Doors Open and Breakfast | Breakfast               |
| Welcome Session          | more coding             |
| Kick Off                 | Lunch                   |
| Lunch                    | Submission Deadline     |
| Knowledge Sessions       | Pitches, Demos or Botr  |
| Dinner                   | Announcement of Winners |
| Pitch Workshop           | Closing Session         |

If you’re running a hackathon all night, make sure participants can come
and go and have access to all facilities no matter the hour. This is
critical for restrooms. Also keep an eye on the temperature: if it is
too cold, your participants might have trouble concentrating. If it’s
too warm, they could fall asleep. Extreme temperatures either way could
mean your participants leave before they finish.

### Terms and Conditions

A document with terms and conditions is a must-have. It spells out the
rules, defines who is responsible for what and provides the terms for
the prize. This document also informs participants of the scope,
process, evaluation criteria and team composition.

### Get on the Web

You’ll need to be on the web to advertise your hackathon and provide
details about the event such as the location, time, terms and
conditions, and the agenda. A draft presentation is also helpful. You
can build or set up a website yourself, you can also use devpost.com. It
has helpful tools for participants and for managing the event, and it
can even take care of registration.

### Registration

You’ll need a registration form on the web that makes it easy to sign
up.

Think about the information you want participants to provide and make
sure you don’t ask for too much. The goal is a simple form that people
can fill out quickly. You can also use Eventbrite or an equivalent
service to handle registration.

A handy tip: After you have the URL and if you’re doing most things
yourself, you can use bit.ly or a similar provider to shorten the link
so it’s easy to share on social media.

Not only that, but you can track who is clicking it and where they came
from.

### Sponsors and Partners

The more assistance you can get, the better.

Partners lend credibility to your effort, can help you find participants
and can even provide staff. And usually, all you have to do is
incorporate their brand into your marketing assets. Sponsors also lend
credibility to your event. They can contribute anything from prizes to
the venue for the hackathon, from merchandising to food.

For example, a university sponsor could provide the venue, a pizzeria
near the university could contribute food, and a printer tied to the
university could take care of producing materials. In return, you can
offer them the opportunity to recruit, talk about their product in one
of your knowledge sessions, and add their branding to your promotional
materials. There is little trade-off on your part when you consider the
benefits.

### Judges

For your judge or panel of judges, you need to find people who inspire
trust and really know the subject matter. At least one of the
instructors and a representative from a partner organization must act as
judges..

### Prizes

There are all kinds of prizes given away at hackathons: money, the
hottest new tech toys, etc. We recommend that you offer money, and the
greater the amount, the better. However, it’s best to check the tax laws
in your area to make sure that participants won’t get penalized too much
for winning.

Also, consider checking with your sponsors or partners to see if they
can offer anything. After you’ve decided on the prize, make sure that
all communications that mention the prize are clear and that
participants will get exactly what you advertise. For example, if you
have decided that the prize is money, you should break down the value of
the prizes. And make sure your grand prize is much more valuable so that
it’s clear that it is what they should be striving for. It adds
incentive to the hackathon.

### Staff

Here are some suggestions for how to staff your hackathon:

“The Maestro” - Main point of contact:

This person will be the face of the event for participants and will
welcome the judge or panel of judges when they arrive.

“Welcomer” - Registration and check-in manager: At least one person who
takes care of registration and participant selection.

“Venue jedi” - Facilities managers: The people who make sure that food
is always available and comes on time, removes the trash, checks
restrooms, and more.

“Geek” - IT manager: The person who makes sure the technical side is
working.

“Beat reporter” - Social media specialist: This digital journalist takes
pictures, shares them on social media, live tweets, and sets up Facebook
live videos. The beat reporters also interview participants, judges, and
others.

”Press secretary” - Communications liaison: This person takes care of
any press covering the event.

### Marketing Materials

Design, Design and Design Here are some ideas for brand assets and
giveaways:

Website design (a content management system like Wordpress is a great
way to build and design your web page or pages easily and quickly. And
updating the website is a breeze)

Posters

Name tags

Prizes, signs and backdrops (something like this is great for photos)

T-shirts (these are cool 1, 2, 3)

These materials are an extension of our brand, so look for consistency.
You should coordinate with IOHK’s Marketing, Comms and Event team.

## Phase 2 \| Promoting Your Event

Most hackathons, like any event, have a drop-off from number of
registrations to actual attendees. Therefore, your goal is to overbook!
Promotion is the most critical element in attracting registrations, and
it is also key to the overall success of your hackathon. You start by
defining your target and figuring out how to reach them. Professionals
are likely to respond to thought leaders in your industry or sector—in
meetups, on social media, and at events. College students are likely to
be enticed by a great party.

The next step is making sure you have a consistent tone that resonates
with your targets by defining your communication style, along with the
best way to tell participants why you’re hosting the hackathon. After
you’ve made these important decisions, here’s a sample of a
communication plan you can use to build your timeline.

### General Promotion

Here are some ideas for attracting registration and participants:

Create a challenge where the winner receives an access code to a video
with tips on winning the competition.

Develop a social media campaign that starts with teasers and then
promotes the event all over Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn once
registration is live.

Ask developer communities for help or if you can post about it in their
forums.

Meet with local media to arrange press coverage.

Invite bloggers to promote and follow the event and give them access to
judges or information.

Post the Hackathon to your website or DevPost.

### Social Media

These social media ideas can also help:

Pre-event promotion and online conversation monitoring during the event.

Create a Facebook event page and Twitter account. Ask other hackathons
to tweet about you.

Send out teasers about your event on Twitter and see if you can get
well-connected individuals to spread the word as well.

Tag and post about sponsors, prizes and any cool judges or personalities
who will be there.

Create and use an event hashtag. Encourage people to share on social
networks during the event. (use our hashtag # and we will retweet you.)

Create a blog post or article about your event and work to get local
media to pick it up.

Encourage partners, sponsors, judges and organizers to post about the
event. Tag them on Twitter. Post information on various LinkedIn and
Meetup groups.

### Promoting to Schools, Colleges and Universities

Students are usually excited to participate in hackathons, so these are
things you can do to reach that audience:

- Contact student groups and let them know about your hackathon.

- Organize talks.

- Organize or sponsor a party.

- Appoint a student as an “ambassador” to help you promote locally in
    > a specific department.

## Phase 3 \| Advance Preparation

Some things must be set up before the hackathon.

These things take time and must be done on time. We’ve broken this down
into one month before, the week before and one day before.

### One Month Before

Here’s what you should be doing one month before the hackathon.

**Branding the Venue:** Your imagination and budget should be your only
limits. Branding Your Merchandise Cool things to give away are a must.
Here are some ideas of what you can brand and give out at check-in:

- Tote or canvas bag

- T-shirt

- Notebook and pen

- Power bank

- Headphones

- Toothbrush and toothpaste

- Anti-bacterial wipes

- Sleeping mask

- Earplugs

- Anti-stress ball or fidget spinner

### Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner

Feeding participants at the hackathon takes preparation. So, this is the
time to make arrangements because it’s important to be all set when
hungry attendees arrive. Some golden rules for hackathons that you’ll
need to discuss with restaurants, caterers and sponsors are:

You need plenty of coffee and water.

Meals should be quick. Pizza, burgers, tacos and bagels are popular menu
choices.

Remember that you’ll also need fruit and other snacks.

If attendees have any special dietary needs or restrictions (vegan,
peanut allergies), you should find out and make sure they are
accommodated. We recommend asking them about their requirements when
they sign up for the event.

Sugar and salt are important, so ask your providers, sponsors and others
who have had successful hackathons what you can do to strike the right
balance.

### Staff Allocation

If you’re running an overnight event, you’ll want to start rounding up
staff to work in shifts so everyone can sleep, bathe, and eat. The
sooner you can do this, the better. Depending on how many people you
have, you can choose between 6 or 8-hour shifts. Here’s a sample
schedule.

Mentor Allocation You won’t need all of your mentors to be available at
the same time nor do you want to annoy participants with the same
explanation five times in a row. Allocate mentor time throughout the
event and don’t schedule them for more than 1-2 hours. If you have this
schedule worked out before you approach your mentors, they are more
likely to agree.

Brief Your Host or Hosts In the initial considerations phase, you should
have identified and gotten agreement from a host or hosts to present the
kick-off session, announce meals, enact the code freeze, and to emcee
the final event.

Now’s the time to:

Brief them.

Determine the length of time they’ll talk.

Review any slides they might be presenting for the kick-off and update
if necessary.

### The Week Before

It’s almost crunch time. There are a number of things you’ll want to do
5-7 days before the hackathon.

### Close Registration and Send Reminder Emails

Probably no one will forget! But it’s good to remind participants,
judges, mentors and staff of the final details, including the venue,
parking information and schedules. Your agenda should be final, you
should close registration, and take down the page.

### Final Orders

Now that you have a headcount for participants, you should finalize your
orders for t-shirts, food, drinks, tables, chairs, giveaways and
anything else.

### Printing

In this crucial week, it’s time to print all marketing materials that
you need to provide at the venue or to participants. Make sure the
printers know when to deliver and that they’ll be ready to go to the
venue on time.

Here are things you’ll want to print:

1. The participants list (or use the Eventbrite app)

2. The evaluation form (for the judges)

3. Print numbers to allocate teams to a table at the venue

### The Day Before

This is the time to get everything set. To avoid stress, questions, and
uncertainty, don’t leave until it’s done. Here’s what you need to do:

1. Set up the check-in area (registration, merchandise, banners, etc.).
    > This is where you greet the participants and they pick up their
    > credentials and sign the terms and conditions, so it has to look
    > sharp and have everything you need. Ideally, there will be a
    > storage area you can organize so your staff has a place for coats,
    > bags, and packages. If there isn’t one, designate a separate room
    > for storage and make sure it’s set up as a place where staff can
    > store things, eat, and rest.

2. Put tables where they need to be for easy access to power and then
    > make sure each one has the proper amount of paper, post-it notes,
    > pens, and other things participants will need. Number the tables
    > so everyone knows where to sit.

3. Test the wifi one last time. Know what to do or who to contact if
    > there’s a problem.

4. Set up the areas for food, rest, and other necessities.

## Phase 4 \| The Hackathon

The big day is here! Time to run the show.

Before the participants arrive, make sure that breakfast is set up and
ready for them. Trying to get a meal ready while people stream in is
rarely effective and can be stressful for everyone.

### Welcome the Participants

Be sure everyone is ready in the check-in area before the doors open so
they can start welcoming the participants the minute they arrive. Smiles
are the most important thing at this point.

### Kick-off Session

Your host will have arrived before this session, so he or she can be
ready when the time comes to introduce the competition; present the
staff, mentors, and panel of judges; and guide everyone through the
agenda. The host should be prepared to answer any questions the
participants might have quickly. Teams are eager to start!

### Time to Eat

Half an hour before meals, get your “food court” ready. Empty trash
cans, set up napkins and be prepared to feed all those hungry people.

### Code Freeze

This is the time everyone needs to stop, and you have to be fair. No one
should be exempt, nor should it be done in a way where some people keep
working while others are shutting down. Participants can send you the
projects or even take their computers to the final presentation but
there should be no more coding (or developing).

### Qualifying Round

If you have more than 10 teams in your hackathon, a wise strategy is to
have a qualifying round for the top 10.

Otherwise, your session will be too long and the judges won’t be able to
pay careful attention to each team.

To choose the top 10 teams, you ask all of them for a two-minute pitch
while the judges listen and ask questions. The judges then pick the 10
finalists. After that, everyone will probably need about 15 minutes to
breathe before the final pitches start.

### Final Pitch

Yes, this is the critical moment. Teams will present their ideas and
demos.

The ideal time to give each team is 3-5 minutes. It’s better if you
allot time for the judges to ask questions. Another way to decide how
long the pitch should be is to use this formula: Available Time For
Presentations/# of Teams. Example: 90 min/15 teams = 6 min (4 min
presentation + 2 min Q&A).

Record every team pitch and take photos.

Decision Time Judges can take up to 30 minutes to make their decisions.
It’s a good idea to offer food, drinks, a fun activity or even a
presentation to keep the participants occupied while they wait.

### Announcing the Winners

Finally, you have winners. As you share the thrilling news, remember to
thank everyone. Having your prizes close to the stage is helpful, too.

### After-Party

After the prizes are given out, a nice touch is to have a social hour or
after-party where participants can converse and relax after such intense
work.

### Final Clean-Up

Once the participants leave, it’s time to clean up. If you haven’t hired
a company to help, this responsibility falls on you.

## Phase 5 \| After the Hackathon

In the days after the event, you have a few-more things to do.

### Follow-Up

You’ll want to keep in touch with your participants and share the
results with the world.

Start by:

Sending a follow-up email

Posting follow-up tweets

Publishing videos of the event

Another important follow-up activity is sending surveys to attendees,
sponsors, judges, mentors and staff to gauge the success of the event
from their eyes, things you can improve in case you do it again, and how
satisfied everyone was.

For participants, you should also ask, “Would you recommend this
hackathon to a friend?”

### Demonstrate Results

Share the videos of participant presentations or just make a final clip
(for promoting your next hackathon). Gather your data and see if your
goals were met; everyone needs to see measurable results.

### Use Your Survey Responses

Take note from your surveys of the kinds of things that you should do
differently next time around. Feel free to share information with us,
and we can update the this guide.

### Celebrate

Be sure you and the staff toast your success and celebrate your effort!

TEMPLATES

### HACKATHON EVALUATION CRITERIA

#### Technical innovation (idea)

Did the group come up with a good solution to the initial problem or
challenge? Did they understand the problem, and did they involve, for
example, multiple stakeholders?

#### Creativity

How creative has the group been in solving the challenge? Did they come
up with a radical approach, or did they follow existing patterns and
solutions?

#### Execution (demo)

Does the hack work? Is the hack testable, and can the group show the
minimum viable product? The hack does not have to be perfect or
production ready, but does the idea come to live with their demo?

#### Polish (design)

Did the group think about the user interface (UI) and user experience
(UX)? How well designed is their demo? How are the graphics, or how is
the human-computer interaction? Is it easy to use or does it require a
lot of training to master the demo?

#### Business model

Even though it is a hackathon, and the participants have a relative
short time to come up with a solution to a problem, the business model
is something to raise the level of the final ideas. Criteria like
feasibility, economic and societal value and sustainability are
therefore also part of the judging form under the term “business model”.
Is the idea feasible, does it have economic and societal value, and is
it sustainable?

#### Pitch

Pitching is one of the most important things in life. A good pitch, for
example, can get you a new position in a company, letting investors
believe in your innovation, and it can convince customers to buy a new
product or service. Therefore, the hackers will also be judged on their
pitch. Were they convincing enough, was it short and to the point, and
what about their enthusiasm? The pitch can be a maximum of 4 minutes.

### TEAM BUILDING EVENT

If your hackathon will have teams formed by individuals who don’t know
one another, a team-building event enables participants to meet and
decide who they want to team up with.

For this event, which is held before the hackathon so teams are ready
when it starts, you need an informal setting, such as a coffee bar or
pub, where people can have drinks and food. You can publicize it with
posters and offer registration on your website.

When participants arrive, assign numbers on the name tags of each, and
then follow these steps:

1. 30-second pitch: Participants can pitch an idea or themselves.

2. 1-hour conversation and discussion: Participants get acquainted over
    > drinks and food (or coffee) and start forming their teams based on
    > the pitches and discussions.

3. Decision time: Ask participants to make their final decisions and
    > share them with you. Give them 30 minutes

4. Collect the information: You now have your teams for the hackathon.
